# Deep Learning using R


This repository contains an implementation of a simple recurrent neuronal network only using R.
It is used to assign a sentence consisting of words to a class. A forward-backward implementation of the same model
is also provided.

Furthermore, this repository contains an R only implementation of a LSTM.
